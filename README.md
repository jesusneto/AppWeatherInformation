<h2 id="technologies">ðŸ’» Technologies used:</h2>

- <a href="https://dagger.dev/hilt/">Dagger Hilt</a> is for dependency injection
- <a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> is a REST Client for Android which makes easier to retrieve and upload structured data like JSON via REST.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel">ViewModel</a> is a class designed to store and manage UI-related data in a conscious way.
- <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata">Live Data</a> observes changes in the data and automatically update the UI when the data changes.
- <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">Coroutines</a> are a tool for managing asynchronous operations, which allow tasks to run without blocking
  the main thread, improving app responsiveness.

<h2 id="technologies">Architecture</h2>

- Pattern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">Model-View-ViewModel</a> (MVVM) which is a software architectural pattern that separates an
  application's user interface (the View) from its underlying data and business logic (the Model and ViewModel).

<h2 id="technologies">Installation</h2>

This application requires a minimum API level of 24. Clone the repository. Also you will need an API key from the Open Weather site to request weather data. If you donâ€™t have an account, 
you will have to create one in order to request an API Key.
